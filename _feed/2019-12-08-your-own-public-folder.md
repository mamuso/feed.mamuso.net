I saw this morning [this tweet](https://twitter.com/jimniels/status/1202251446688858113), where Jim Nielsen talks about emulating the old dropbox public folder behavior using BitBar and Netlify. He explains all the details in [his post](https://blog.jim-nielsen.com/2019/netlify-public-folder-part-iii-how/).
