This feed should be about what I build, not about building the feed.

I'm going to spend a couple of days moving this feed over to NextJS. I enjoy Gatsby; it is a fantastic piece of software that, unfortunately, I don't use for any other project. I find myself a bit disoriented every time I need to pick it up from where I left off.
